      My passion for writing code began with the HTML pages I would write to create the coolest MySpace layouts this side of the Mississippi.
      After years in and out of college and juggling multiple jobs, I decided I would teach myself web development. It was fun and I created some pretty cool things, but I was only following tutorials. I needed structure and community (duh!) so in September 2021, I officially enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp.
